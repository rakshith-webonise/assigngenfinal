basic git commands:

1)git clone: clones the repository from github
2)Adds files changes in your working directory to your index.
3)git commit
Takes all of the changes written in the index, creates a new commit object pointing to it and sets the branch to point to that new commit
4)git branch
Lists existing branches, including remote branches if ‘-a’ is provided. Creates a new branch if a branch name is provided
